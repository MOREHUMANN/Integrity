# Integrity: Emotional Intelligence Module


**Author:** T. Narayan (@MOREHUMAN)  
**License:** Apache 2.0  
**Status:** Research-phase — Open to collaboration

---

## 🌐 Overview

This repository contains the **Emotional Intelligence Module** of **Project Integrity**, a larger initiative exploring emotionally clustered AI shaped through user interaction and adaptive dialogue.

> ⚠️ Only this emotional module is being shared publicly.  
> Other modules of Integrity are private and will remain undisclosed.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create an AI module capable of:
- Clustering emotional behaviors into *color-coded psychological patterns*
- Adapting dynamically to user moods and interactions
- Switching between emotional “shades” mid-conversation
- Forming a unique emotional identity per user (based on chat data)

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Emotional Colorspace**: Human emotional states mapped into color-clustered representations
- **Shade Switching**: Real-time transitions based on sentiment/mood cues
- **User-shaped Personality**: Each AI module evolves uniquely per individual
- **Decentralized Emotional Memory**: Temporary emotional state storage that enhances short- and long-term interaction quality

## 📁 Repository Structure: Integrity – Emotional Module

This repository outlines the **Emotional Intelligence Module** of the Integrity AI framework. It focuses on dynamically evolving emotional patterns based on user interaction and conversational clustering. The full Integrity system may contain other private modules not represented here.
