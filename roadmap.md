### Project Integrity – Emotional Module Roadmap

---

### 🚀 Phase 0: Vision Finalization & Ideation (✅ Completed)

* Define philosophical grounding of the project (emotional color clustering, user-shaped personalities)
* Clarify boundaries of the emotional module vs other Integrity modules
* Establish high-level use cases and filter needs
* Draft initial documents (`README.md`, `abstract.md`, `risks_ethics.md`, `ethical_use.md`)

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Open Publishing & Community Onboarding (IN PROGRESS)

* [ ] Upload full base documentation to GitHub (modular markdown files)
* [ ] Publish the emotional module as a standalone research-friendly subproject
* [ ] Assign Apache 2.0 or custom license based on contribution guidelines
* [ ] Setup GitHub Discussions / Issues for public feedback
* [ ] Create presence on: Reddit, Hugging Face, Twitter/X, Mastodon
* [ ] Set up official email & GitHub profile branding
* [ ] Invite initial collaborators with aligned ethical standards

---

### 🌐 Phase 2: Data Strategy & Collection Planning

* [ ] Design a modular structure for emotional memory + LLM alignment
* [ ] Define anonymized and consent-based data collection rules
* [ ] Partner with open platforms (Hugging Face, Open Assistant, Poe, etc.)
* [ ] Build open-source pipeline for importing human-shaped conversational logs for emotional profiling
* [ ] Start with simulated dataset for testing color/emotion clustering logic

---

### 📊 Phase 3: Emotional Framework Architecture

* [ ] Build core modules:

  * Emotional Shade Engine (ESE)
  * Color-State Tracker (CST)
  * Mood Context Handler (MCH)
  * Ethical Filter Layer (EFL)
* [ ] Integrate emotional shifts within memory simulation (lightweight local inference models)
* [ ] Establish open-source testing interface for developers
* [ ] Collect test results + build diagnostics to prevent emotional overfitting or identity merging

---

### 🤖 Phase 4: AI Integration Prototypes

* [ ] Integrate module with open LLM APIs (LLaMA, Mixtral, DeepSeek, etc.)
* [ ] Integrate multimodal feedback (text, voice emotion, hand-gesture simulation)
* [ ] Test memory retention simulation across different sessions (clustered shade persistence)
* [ ] Begin work on mini-emotion simulation bots for GitHub, Discord, or Web

---

### ⚡ Phase 5: User Interface + Demo

* [ ] Design lightweight UI showing emotion shade clustering
* [ ] Display memory changes in color-coded timelines
* [ ] Let users shape emotion responses by interaction only (no direct config)
* [ ] Publish open beta with feedback form, logs and transparency engine

---

### ⚖️ Phase 6: Review, Filter Enforcement & Licensing Extensions

* [ ] Implement stricter contributor license agreement (CLA)
* [ ] Finalize Emotional Module as separate package or integrated system
* [ ] Propose safeguards and auditing frameworks
* [ ] Collaborate with ethical boards or research groups
* [ ] Begin publication in AI ethics journals / conferences

---

### 🌟 Phase 7: Scale / Internal Extensions (Post Open Release)

* [ ] Mirror idea to other modules in Integrity (e.g., Decision-making, Curiosity, Perception)
* [ ] Evaluate the ecosystem impact of human-shaped AIs via tracked usage
* [ ] Possibly launch private hosted inference version with strict filters and usage guardrails

---

### 🚀 Final Goal: A distributed, emotionally intelligent AI infrastructure that learns ethically from humans while remaining grounded, filtered, and uniquely shaped by its user – **without compromising on individual autonomy or safety.**
